# CPPOperators_BitwiseOperators
A short introduction and understanding of basic logical and bitwise operators in C++ using 2 input integers.

ALGORITHM:

Start.
Accept input for 2 integers.

Declare variables to store the result of addition , subtraction, multiplication , division, logical AND, logical OR, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR.

Execute respective operations and store result.(Using '+' for addition , '-' for subtraction, '*' for multiplication, '/' for divsion, '&&' for logical AND, '||' for logical OR, '&' for bitwise AND, '|' for bitwise OR, '^' for bitwise XOR)

Display respective result.

End.
